# Node API Skeleton
This is a simple API skeleton for a Node.js/MySQL-based applications.

# Recommended Applications
* Get [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).
    * Available on all platforms. Postman allows you to test your API endpoints thoroughly and without a frontend application or a web browser.
* Get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
    * Available on Windows, Mac and Linux, VS Code is a powerful text editor with an integrated terminal and a ton of features for working with Node.js-based servers. Most Node.js developers swear by it, myself and the original creator of this codebase included.
    * [Atom](https://atom.io) by GitHub may also work, but is slow and has less features out of the box. Both are owned by Microsoft, anyhow, so use Microsoft's flagship product instead.

# Dependencies
* Git
* MySQL
    * MariaDB is a version of MySQL maintained by the original creator with more features.
* Node.js with NPM

## Windows
First, we install the [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) package manager. This allows you to install dependencies in a similar fashion to *apt-get* on Linux.

To install it, open PowerShell as Administrator, and then type:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Sometimes it may ask you for permissions again. Just type 'A' and press enter.

Run these in Powershell as Administrator:
```powershell
choco install nodejs-lts mariadb git
```

Then **restart your computer**.

## macOS
First, install the [brew](https://brew.sh) package manager. This allows you to install packages in a dependencies fashion to *apt-get* on Linux.

To install it, just paste this into your Terminal:
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

After the installation is done:

```bash
brew install mariadb node
# This command launches MySQL
brew services start mariadb
```

## Debian-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, etc.)
In your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm mariadb-client mariadb-server git
```

That's it!

On some versions of Linux, if the command `node` doesn't work, you may need to do this:

```bash
ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

## Other Linux
Chances are, if you're using another Linux, you know what you're doing and can probably install these dependencies on your own. :)

# Usage
These steps are applicable for all platforms, including Windows.

Inside your Terminal or Powershell Admin Instance:
## One-time steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/donn/nodejs-api-skeleton
# Go inside
cd nodejs-api-skeleton
# Install package dependencies
npm install
# Setup Database
cat Database.sql | sudo mysql -u root # DO NOT WRITE THE "SUDO" ON WINDOWS
```
## From now on
```bash
npm run start
```

You can then visit http://localhost:3000/myroute/hw in your web browser or GET it via Postman to verify it works.
